                    <h3>Pizza</h3>
                    <p>The prototype of pizza were some dishes served on slices of bread in the homes of the ancient Greeks and Romans. In connection with the import of tomatoes into Europe in 1522, Italian pizza first appeared in Naples. In the 17th century, a special kind of baker appeared, pizzaiolo (Italian: pizzaiolo), who prepared pizza for Italian peasants.</p>

                    <h3>Pasta</h3>
                    <p>Researchers believe that the history of the appearance of pasta goes back to the Neolithic. It was when people learned to grow cereals, and a little later grind cereals into flour, that the appearance of pasta was only a matter of time. The first paste was just flour mixed with water and dried in the sun.</p>

                    <h3>Borscht</h3>
                    <p>The first information about borscht dates back to Kievan Rus, from which both modern states originated. Subsequently, it became part of the national cuisine not only of Russia and Ukraine, but also of Poland, Lithuania, Moldova and other countries.</p>

                    <p>Stew (stew with vegetables, cereals, legumes, nuts, mushrooms, spices and, in principle, everything that the cook can get his hands on) is perhaps the most ancient dish on earth. Its oldest variation is found in ancient Indian epics already 8000 years ago.</p>

                    <h3>Dangerous food</h3>
                    <p>According to archaeologists, dangerous fish were eaten even before our era. During excavations of ancient sites, fugu bones were discovered. However, at the beginning of the 16th century, a ban was introduced on catching this fish. It was filmed two hundred years later, when Japanese Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi, a famous gourmet, tried the poisonous food.</p>
